OCR-based Answer Recognition and Scoring System
<h1>Overview</h1>
This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model that processes images containing answers, recognizes characters, and matches them with predefined correct answers stored in the form of a dictionary. Based on the matched answers, a score is calculated and provided as output.

The system can be used for automatic answer grading or any scenario where you need to compare handwritten or printed answers with predefined responses.
